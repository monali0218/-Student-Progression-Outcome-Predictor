# -Student-Progression-Outcome-Predictor
Developed a Python-based Student Progression Outcome Predictor, which determines academic progression outcomes based on university regulations.
he program validates user input, predicts progression categories (Progress, Module Trailer, Module Retriever, or Exclude), and generates a graphical histogram of results using graphics.py. It also extends functionality by storing and retrieving data using lists and text files. Implemented structured programming with user-defined functions and efficient conditional logic to enhance code readability and maintainability.
